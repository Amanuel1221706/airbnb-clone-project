#UI/UX Design Planning

#Design Goals
- Ensure intuitive navigation for users.
- Mobile responsiveness for all pages.
- Fast-loading, minimalistic UI.
- Clear and consistent branding.

# Key Features to Implement

Body text: 14–16px
Metadata : 12px

Iportance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
Understanding the design properties in a mockup is crucial because:

Ensures Consistency – Reusing color styles and typography creates a clean, unified look across all screens.

Speeds Up Development – Developers can quickly implement styles without guessing or manually matching them.

Improves Collaboration – Designers and developers speak the same "visual language."

Enables Scalability – Consistent styles make it easy to maintain and extend the UI.

Better User Experience – Thoughtful color and type choices enhance usability, readability, and accessibility.
